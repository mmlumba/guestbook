# Front End Setup
[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/get-started/)

This is used as my front end state management tool. It's like Redux, but for Apollo/GraphQL. [Why?](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/why-apollo/)

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Used to bootstrap a React app quickly.

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

Sets up pretty UI components in React if you don't feel like tinkering with CSS too much.
