# Guestbook
A fullstack JavaScript app that allows a user to add comments to a web app. It also shows the wonderful magic of GraphQL, Apollo, and React.

Both folders (client/server) are separate apps that need to be run separately.

To view the frontend:
```
cd client
npm start
```

To run the backend:
```
1. cd server
2. create .env file with MONGO_CONNECT_URL from .env.example in server directory
3. npm start
```

Check out the _presentation_ branch if you'd like to see further commented code and details on how `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks work!
