# Guestbook
A fullstack JavaScript app that allows a user to add comments to a web app. It also shows the wonderful magic of GraphQL, Apollo, and React.

**This branch is used for presentations, which is why there's lots of comments in the code :)**

Both folders (client/server) are separate apps that need to be run separately.

To view the frontend:
```
cd client
npm start
```

To run the backend:
```
cd server
npm start
```
